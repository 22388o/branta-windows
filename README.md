 - âœ… Sparrow
 - âœ… Wasabi
 - âœ… Trezor

## Known Limitations

- Spoof Wallets likely install to custom paths. Branta needs to have more flexible path scanning to catch these.
- Ongoing wallet support - Branta doesn't know about new releases unless we manually input them.

## Feature Requests & Bug Reporting

Open a [new issue](https://github.com/BrantaOps/branta-windows/issues/new) on Github and we'll reply as soon as we can.

## Policy on Altcoins/Altchains

Branta is Bitcoin-only. Enduring Bitcoin products are difficult to build; adding support for the unstable, poorly designed altcoin ecosystem is a lose-lose proposition.

## Licensing

The code in this project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).
